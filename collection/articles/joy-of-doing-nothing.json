Just you, your thoughts, and maybe a ceiling fan.<br><br> In today’s go-go-go culture, “doing nothing” sounds lazy or even wasteful. <br> But taking small breaks — like 10 minutes of just sitting still — can actually reset your brain. <br> It’s like giving your mind a breath of fresh air.<br><br> You don’t have to meditate or be super spiritual about it. <br> Just sit down, stare out a window, and don’t feel guilty. <br> Your brain will thank you later with more focus, better ideas, and way less stress. <br> Give it a shot.</p>",

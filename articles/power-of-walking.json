One of the best things you can do for your body and mind is something you’ve been doing since you were a toddler: walking.\n\nYup — simple, steady walking.\n\nA 20-30 minute walk each day can do wonders.  \nIt boosts your mood, helps with digestion, supports heart health, and even sparks creativity.  \nThere’s a reason some of the world’s greatest thinkers — like Steve Jobs — took walking meetings.\n\nThe best part? No fancy equipment, gym membership, or app required.  \nJust comfy shoes, a sidewalk (or a park), and some time to yourself.  \nYou can listen to music, call a friend, or just let your thoughts wander.  \nIt’s low impact, so your knees and joints won’t hate you for it.  \nPlus, it helps clear your head in ways scrolling Instagram never will.\n\nSo if life feels a little overwhelming or you’re just stuck on a problem, take a walk.  \nYou might not solve everything, but you’ll definitely feel better when you get back.\n\nWho knew something so simple could be so powerful?",

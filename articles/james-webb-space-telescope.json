    "content": "<p>For decades, the Hubble Space Telescope has shown us incredible images of the cosmos — but in 2022, it got a much bigger, more advanced sibling: the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).<br> And since it went online, it's been blowing everyone’s minds.</p><p>Unlike Hubble, which mostly sees visible and ultraviolet light, JWST looks at the universe in infrared.<br> That’s a big deal, because infrared can pierce through clouds of dust and gas that block visible light.<br> It’s like switching from blurry sunglasses to a pair of night vision goggles — suddenly, you can see way more.</p><p>So far, JWST has captured stunningly detailed images of galaxies that formed over 13 billion years ago,<br> just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.<br> That’s basically looking back in time to the early universe.<br> It’s helping scientists figure out how galaxies evolved, how stars are born,<br> and even what kinds of atmospheres exist on exoplanets (planets outside our solar system).<br> Yes — that means we’re getting closer to identifying planets that could actually support life.</p><p>But JWST isn’t just about pretty pictures.<br> It's also giving us new data on black holes, dark matter,<br> and the building blocks of life like carbon and water in deep space.</p><p>In short? The James Webb Space Telescope is giving humanity a front-row seat to the most epic story ever told:<br> the story of the universe itself.<br> And we’ve only just started chapter one.</p>",

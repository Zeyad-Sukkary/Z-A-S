  "content": "For decades, the Hubble Space Telescope has shown us incredible images of the cosmos — but in 2022, it got a much bigger, more advanced sibling: the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).  \nAnd since it went online, it's been blowing everyone’s minds.\n\nUnlike Hubble, which mostly sees visible and ultraviolet light, JWST looks at the universe in infrared.  \nThat’s a big deal, because infrared can pierce through clouds of dust and gas that block visible light.  \nIt’s like switching from blurry sunglasses to a pair of night vision goggles — suddenly, you can see way more.\n\nSo far, JWST has captured stunningly detailed images of galaxies that formed over 13 billion years ago,  \njust a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.  \nThat’s basically looking back in time to the early universe.  \nIt’s helping scientists figure out how galaxies evolved, how stars are born,  \nand even what kinds of atmospheres exist on exoplanets (planets outside our solar system).  \nYes — that means we’re getting closer to identifying planets that could actually support life.\n\nBut JWST isn’t just about pretty pictures.  \nIt's also giving us new data on black holes, dark matter,  \nand the building blocks of life like carbon and water in deep space.\n\nIn short? The James Webb Space Telescope is giving humanity a front-row seat to the most epic story ever told:  \nthe story of the universe itself.  \nAnd we’ve only just started chapter one.",

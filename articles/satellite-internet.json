What happens when countries compete over orbital “real estate”?\n\nStill, innovation is happening fast.  \nSpeeds are improving, hardware is getting cheaper, and more players are entering the game.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nIn a world that’s becoming more connected every day, satellite internet offers something rare: the promise of universal access.  \nWhether you’re on a mountain top, in a fishing boat, or deep in the Amazon rainforest, the ability to connect to the digital world is becoming less of a luxury — and more of a right.\n\nThanks to space-based internet, the phrase “I don’t have service here” might soon be a thing of the past.",

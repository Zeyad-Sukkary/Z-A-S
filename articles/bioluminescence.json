Cold, efficient light — no heat, no flame, just pure glow.\n\nScientists are fascinated by this glowing biology.  \nResearchers are already using bioluminescence in medical research, including tracking how diseases spread in the body.  \nAnd who knows? In the future, we might even use bio-glowing tech for eco-friendly lighting or warning systems.\n\nFrom the darkest ocean trenches to glowing forests and starry caves,  \nbioluminescence is proof that nature has its own kind of magic — and it’s lighting the way in more ways than we ever imagined.",

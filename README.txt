Ver 8.2.0

 Z-A-S Website Update — April 16, 2025
🚀 Big Changes & Cleanup!
🗂️ 1. Removed Old Pages (Trending & Latest)
Before:
You had separate pages for "Trending" and "Latest" news.

Now:
They're gone! You no longer need separate pages — the homepage (or the new Discover page) can now handle all sorting in one place, making the site cleaner and easier to manage.

🌟 2. Introduced the All-New Discover Page
A fresh page that lets users browse and sort articles using a dropdown menu.

🕒 Sort by Date (default)

🔥 Sort by Trending

🅰️ Sort by Title

👤 Sort by Author

📁 Sort by Category

This gives users full control over how they view the news — all in one spot.

🧱 3. Smart Article Layout with JSON
Articles are now powered by a JSON file that includes:

Title, Author, Date, Content

Slug for linking

Category and Trending flag

No more hardcoding! Just update the JSON to manage all articles.

🎨 4. Fully Styled Dynamic Previews
Each preview is:

Automatically created with JS

Styled like the rest of the site (buttons, images, shadows, hover effects)

Comes with a “read more” link that opens the full article by slug
